External Libraries
------------------

The firmware was originally developed with CMSIS 3.01

This should be placed in lib/CMSIS

Building DK2 Firmware
---------------------

Building DK2 firmware currently requires IAR EWARM.  You can get a 30-day trial

Programming DK2 Firmware to a Board
-----------------------------------

### Updating an already programmed board

You can update a DK2 over USB using the Oculus Configuration Utility:
https://product-guides.oculus.com/en-us/documentation/dk2/latest/tasks/ug-tray-start-firmware/

In this case, you should use the most recent DK2.bin available for your board.

* Rev 3 (GDC units): prj/REV3/Exe/DK2.bin
* Rev 3.3 (Pilot run and production units): prj/REV3_3/Exe/DK2.bin

### Programming to a blank board

For a blank board, you'll need to program it over the SWD header using an
ST-Link programmer.

In this case, you'll need the ST-Link utility and DK2Bootloader.bin

* Rev 3 (GDC units): bootloader/prj/REV3/Exe/DK2Bootloader.bin
* Rev 3.3 (Pilot run and production units):
    bootloader/prj/REV3_3/Exe/DK2Bootloader.bin
